This project was created to analyse the connections between nodes. 
The program takes in one file, containing two columns of integers with a space between each pair on each line. A connection is formed between two integers present on each line.
The purpose of the program is to take in all these connections and output meaningful data and information about them, such as the number of incoming and outgoing connections
between each individual node and a text matrix to observe a heat map between nodes. 
External tools were used to construct graphs and charts to illustrate the data, all of which can be found in the included PowerPoint file.

This team project was undertaken for my Algorithms and AI module at university.
